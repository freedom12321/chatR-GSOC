  save_script = NULL,
  host = "http://localhost:8000"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Character. Describe what you want to accomplish in R (required)}

\item{mode}{Character. Generation mode (default: "interactive"):
\itemize{
  \item \code{"interactive"}: Generate code with explanations and examples
  \item \code{"script"}: Create complete, professional analysis scripts  
  \item \code{"execute"}: Generate and optionally run code immediately
}}

\item{execute_code}{Logical. Whether to run generated code automatically (default: FALSE)}

\item{save_script}{Character. File path to save generated script (optional)}

\item{host}{Character. ChatR backend URL (default: "http://localhost:8000")}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{code}: Generated R code as character string
    \item \code{explanation}: Text explanation of the approach
    \item \code{full_response}: Complete formatted response
  }
}
\description{
ChatR's most powerful feature - an AI pair programmer that can see your R environment,
write production-quality code, and execute it with your permission. This function
provides interactive code generation, complete script creation, and intelligent
coding assistance tailored to your specific data and requirements.
}
\details{
This function represents ChatR's advanced AI programming assistant that:
\itemize{
  \item Sees your R environment (data, objects, loaded packages)
  \item Writes context-aware, production-quality R code
  \item Provides detailed explanations and best practices
  \item Can execute code with your permission for immediate results
  \item Generates complete analysis scripts from simple descriptions
  \item Offers interactive coding sessions for step-by-step development
}

The generated code follows R best practices, includes error handling,
and is tailored to your specific data structures and analysis needs.
}
\section{Modes}{

\describe{
  \item{interactive}{Best for learning and exploring. Generates code with
    detailed explanations, examples, and educational content.}
  \item{script}{Creates complete, professional scripts ready for production.
    Includes package loading, error handling, and full workflows.}
  \item{execute}{For quick tasks. Generates code and optionally runs it
    immediately for instant results.}
}
}

\section{Environment Awareness}{

ChatR automatically detects and considers:
\itemize{
  \item Available datasets and their structures  
  \item Loaded packages and functions
  \item Variable types and data characteristics
  \item Previous analysis context
}
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load some data first
data(mtcars)
data(iris)

# Interactive mode - Learn with explanations
chatr_code("create a scatter plot of mpg vs hp with a trend line")
chatr_code("show me different ways to handle missing data")

# Script mode - Generate complete analysis
chatr_code("comprehensive exploratory data analysis of mtcars", 
          mode = "script", save_script = "mtcars_analysis.R")

# Execute mode - Quick results  
chatr_code("calculate correlation matrix for numeric variables",
          mode = "execute", execute_code = TRUE)

# Advanced examples
chatr_code("build a machine learning model to predict species in iris")
chatr_code("create publication-quality plots with proper themes")
chatr_code("write a function that automatically detects outliers")
}
